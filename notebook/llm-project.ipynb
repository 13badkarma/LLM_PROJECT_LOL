Entering new RetrievalQA chain...\u001b[0m\n\n\u001b[1m> Finished chain.\u001b[0m\nBased on the provided information, the best rune set for Ahri appears to be Sorcery, particularly when paired with an AD ganking jungler such as Graves or Kindred. The context indicates that Ahri functions \"excellent\" or \"strong\" with these types of junglers, suggesting they complement each other well in terms of gameplay synergy.\n\nThe context does not directly mention Sorcery as the best runes for Ahri in all situations, but it highlights that Ahri works exceptionally well with junglers like Graves and Kindred, who would likely use Sorcery runes to maximize their damage output and sustain.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n1. **Graves (AD Ganking Jungler):**\n   - Ahri is described as \"excellent\" with Graves, indicating strong synergy between the two.\n   - Graves uses Sorcery as his main rune page, focusing on spell vamp, health, and mana regeneration, which aligns well with Ahri’s playstyle.\n\n2. **Kindred (AD Ganking Jungler):**\n   - Similar to Graves, Ahri is also described as \"excellent\" with Kindred.\n   - Kindred also uses Sorcery runes, enhancing his damage and utility, which again pairs well with Ahri.\n\nGiven this information, it can be inferred that Sorcery runes are beneficial for Ahri when she is played alongside AD ganking junglers. However, the context doesn't explicitly state that Sorcery is the absolute best runes for Ahri across all scenarios.\n\nFor a more comprehensive rune build, one might consider looking at additional guides or considering different roles and matchups. For example, Ahri has shown to be playable with AP junglers like Karthus, though it's noted that this setup gives more merc treads to the enemy team, which can be unfavorable.\n\nIn summary, based on the provided information, Sorcery runes are recommended for Ahri when paired with AD ganking junglers like Graves or Kindred due to their synergy and effectiveness.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":7}]}
